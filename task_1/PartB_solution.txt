B. As time passes, the log files for your application have piled up, and the machine
is running out of storage. Briefly describe how you would resolve this in a short
paragraph, taking into considerations that:

a. On rare occasion, logs up to 3 months old are required for troubleshooting
/investigations

b. Audit requirements dictate that logs are to be kept for at least 7 years

c. The machine is currently storing 6 months worth of logs, and would run
out of storage within the week. Increasing storage is not an option within
the next 12 months

Answer: To address the storage issue, I will implement a combination of log rotation and archiving. 
First, I will configure logrotate to manage log files, ensuring that older logs are archived monthly. 
For logs that are older than 1 month, I will compress them using tools like gzip or tar to reduce file sizes and optimize storage on the local machine. 
Compressed logs that are older than 3 months will be moved to external storage solutions, such as an external log server or cloud-based storage like Azure Blob or AWS S3. 
This approach will not only free up space on the local machine but also ensure compliance with audit requirements by securely storing logs for the long term. 
Meanwhile, the most recent logs will remain accessible on the local machine for troubleshooting and operational needs.
